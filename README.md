# Interactive Multi-document Summarization Using Joint Optimization and Active Learning for Content Selection Grounded in User Feedback

In this project, we develop a general framework for Interactive Multi-Document Summarization. We propose an extractive multi-document summarization (MDS) system using joint optimization and active learning for content selection grounded in user feedback.

> **Abstract:** In this paper, we propose an extractive multi-document summarization (MDS) system using joint optimization and active learning for content selection grounded in user feedback. Our method   interactively obtains user feedback to gradually improve the results of a state-of-the-art integer linear programming (ILP) framework for MDS. Our methods complement fully automatic methods in producing   high-quality summaries with a minimum number of iterations and feedbacks. We conduct multiple simulation-based experiments and analyze the effect of feedback-based concept selection in the ILP setup in    order to maximize the user-desired content in the summary.
